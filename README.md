# Image
Pythonic, object-oriented, simple pixel manipulator.

# Functionalities
This small module can be used to:
- import/export an image
- convert color models (RGB, HSV, HSI, HSL, grayscale)
- perform transformations, such as grayscale and sepia
- plot pixel histograms
- compare and calculate the difference between images
- align image histograms
- filter images with kernels (id, up, down, gauss, sobel)
- image thresholding
- edge detection

# Usage and examples
See /examples directory.

# Requirements
Main requirements are cv2, numpy and matplotlib. Last tested on Python 3.13.

It is recommended (but not necessary) to use the module in a Jupyter Notebook, which is included in requirements.txt.
